Day 3: Spent today learning and practicing recursion. One problem led me down an interesting rabbit hole about the different ways to remove the last element of an array in javascript. There are three different ways to do it, and each method returns something different. Definitely a good review of some of javascript's built in methods.","title":"docs/Bola.md"},{"location":"Bola/#day-2-worked-on-developing-a-microservice-at-work-that-receieves-and-logs-client-errors-i-also-spent-some-time-reading-about-preventing-sql-injections-in-go-and-other-vulnerabilities","text":"Day 3: Spent today learning and practicing recursion.
